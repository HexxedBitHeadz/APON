### Assigning IP Variables


Assign variables of Kali and Target IPs so the rest of the commands are simply copy / paste.  Add your target's IP address to the end of this command.

```bash - kali
export KALI=$(ifconfig tun0 | grep -w inet | awk '{print $2}' | tr -d " \t\n\r") && export TARGET=
```

Make a folder of the target IP address and change directory into it.
```bash - kali
mkdir $TARGET && cd $TARGET
```

#### nmap

We can now use the following nmap script to enumerate different phases of scans.
Source code: [[nmap#nmap script]]

Place in directory of your choosing, make executable and run:

```bash - kali
sudo /home/kali/Desktop/nmap.sh $TARGET
```
