- [ ] Check for <u>/robots.txt</u>
- [ ] Check for <u>/security.txt</u>

Use BOTH, dirsearch and feroxbuster.  This section will help the scan results of both tools, combine them into 1 file, sort and unique a final list.  

ROADMAP: 

1. Parse OPTIONS headers (looking for PUT/Delete, etc).  
2. Download all URL findings, attempt to "auto-grep" out findings, such as html comments, keywords like username, password, etc.

#### 1. Dirsearch & Feroxbuster
[[dirsearch]]
- [ ] **dirsearch**

[[Feroxbuster]]
- [ ] **Feroxbuster**

#### 2. Check for /cgi-bin/
If cgi-bin directory is found, re-run dirsearch and feroxbuster at `$TARGET:80/cgi-bin/` with extensions of `cgi`, `sh`, `pl` and `py`.  Also check for [[9._Shell shock]]


#### 3. Combining Dirsearch and Feroxbuster results
Combine Dirsearch and Feroxbuster lists:
```bash - kali
cat feroxbuster-COMMON.txt | tr -s " " | cut -d " " -f 6 | grep http > dirList & cat dirsearch-COMMON.txt | tr -s " " | cut -d " " -f 3 | grep http >> dirList
```

#### Python crawler
[[python crawler]]

```bash - kali
python crawl.py dirList
```

sort / unique results, save to same file:
```bash - kali
sort -u -o dirList{,}
```

To import findings into Burp / Zap (make sure tool is running!):
```bash - kali
for u in $URLS=$(cat dirList); do curl $u --proxy http://localhost:8080; done
```

Now check Burp / Zap, should see urls travel through!

Get headers (needed?):
```bash - kali
for u in $URLS=$(cat dirList | tr -s " " | cut -d " " -f 6); do echo $u & curl -I $u; done
```

Check for Options(Not complete):
```bash - kali
for u in $URLS=$(cat dirList | tr -s " " | cut -d " " -f 6); do echo $u * curl -v -X OPTIONS $u; done
```

#### HTTP Verb Change
- [ ] **Change HTTP Verb**
In this form, we see a lot of "GET" requests, however if we press the buttons or try to visit the URLs, we get "Cannot Connect"

![[Pasted image 20220309204237.png]]

So what we can try is to change the HTTP verb with curl as shown below:
