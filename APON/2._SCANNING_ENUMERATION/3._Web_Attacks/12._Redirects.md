In this example, we find "/accounts.php" in ffuf, but when we try to access it, we get redirected to the "l/ogin.php" page.

With intercept on, request "/accounts.php" again, this time, right click in request, Do intercept > Response to this request.
Hit Forward once, then change "302" to "200".

Now we get an account creation page!
Tried the same thing for "/files.php"
