Another good option to try is:

```
Invoke-Obfuscation
```

Generate a PowerShell reverse shell from anywhere [[1._Reverse Shells (WIN)#]]

Be sure beginning start with $client.... and remove outside quotes if present.  Place in your Kali IP and port.

First, set the script path.

```
SET SCRIPTPATH /home/kali/Desktop/shell.ps1
```

Encode the script.

```
ENCODING
```

SecureString (AES) supposedly works really well.

Copy the output to a new ps1 file.

Transfer to target and run.
