The CGI scripts are perl scripts, so, if you have compromised a server that can execute .cgi scripts you can upload a perl reverse shell (`/usr/share/webshells/perl/perl-reverse-shell.pl`), change the extension from `.pl` to `.cgi`, give execute permissions (`chmod +x`) and access the reverse shell from the web browser to execute it.

In order to test for CGI vulns it's recommended to use `nikto -C` all (and all the plugins)
