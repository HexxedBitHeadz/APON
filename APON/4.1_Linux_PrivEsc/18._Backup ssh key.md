Even if a machine has correct permissions on important or sensitive files, a user may have created insecure backups of these files.

It is always worth exploring the file system looking for readable backup files. Some common places include user home directories, the / (root) directory, /tmp, and /var/backups.

1. Look for interesting files, especially hidden files, in common locations:

```bash - target
ls -la /home/user
```

```bash - target
ls -la /
```

```bash - target
ls -la /tmp
```

```bash - target
ls -la /var/backups
```

2. Note that a hidden .ssh directory exists in the system root:

```bash - target
ls -la /
```

>drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Aug 24 18:57 .ssh

3. In this directory, we can see a world-readable file called root_key :

```bash - target
ls -l /.ssh
```

total 4

-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1679 Aug 24 18:57 root_key

4. Further inspection of this file seems to indicate that this is an SSH private key. The name and owner of the file suggests this key belongs to the root user:

```bash - target
head -n 1 /.ssh/root_key
```

-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----

5. Before we try to use this key, letâ€™s confirm that root logins are even allowed via SSH:
