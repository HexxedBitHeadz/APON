[[4._File Transfers]]

```command prompt - windows
Autoruns.exe
```

In this example, say we found "My Program" entry is pointing to `C:\Program Files\Autorun Program\program.exe`

**Exploitation**

Use accesschk

```command prompt - windows
accesschk64.exe -wvu "C:\Program Files\Autorun Program"
```


The output states that "Everyone" user group has "FILE_ALL_ACCESS" permission on the program.exe file.
