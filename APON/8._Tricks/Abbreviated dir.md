Did you know that c:\program files can also be abbreviated c:\progra~1? DOS accepts either.  
  
You could apply a similar theory to your path.  
If you had a similar DOS machine to use as an example, dir /x shows you abbreviations DOS has for any given directory, although you could also visually reverse engineer the approximate six characters then tilde one. Or sometimes ~2,3 etc if there are similar dirs.

```command prompt - target
dir /x
```
