no_root_squash was found in linpeas.

Requires ssh login creds.

On Kali:
```bash - kali
mkdir Share
```

Here, we ssh into the target box, open a local port of 2049, and forward the traffic from the target box to it.
```bash - kali
proxychains ssh -f -N $USER@$TARGET -L 2049:127.0.0.1:2049
```

```bash - kali
replicate
```

We should be able to see 2049 open on Kali:
```bash - kali
sudo ss -antp | grep 2049
```

```bash - kali
sudo mount -t nfs 127.0.0.1:/srv/Share/ Share
```
