Aromak's Pentesting Obsidian Notes <br />
***Hello and welcome!*** 

APON started as a private collection of notes for pentesting study labs, and has grown to a small collaborative notebook among like-minded enthusiasts.  We wanted to put something together to contribute a little to such a great community that we were able to learn so much from, and in hopes to help someone else coming into such an amazing journey.

Please take a moment to finish this readme, as there is some really important things to go over.  Thanks!

## Important notes
***BE AWARE*** 
These are pentesting notes, therefore, will include malicious payloads and code!  Windows Virus & Threat Protection will likely yell at you if these files are just downloaded.  ***Either only use in a VM environment, or consider using an excluded space from antivirus for these notes on Windows host.***

This resource was made with, and best formatted for Obsidian Notes.  We cannot guarantee full functionality utilizing any other notebook application.

***How to get the most out of this resource?***
Every new engagement starts at [[__.Starting_Point]], which is meant to set you up for the rest of the notebook.  Here, we assign the Kali IP to the variable KALI (pay attention to the network interface used), and then assigns the target IP to the variable TARGET.  We do this so that moving forward, we can utilize the power of variables and copy / paste scripts and commands faster and easier.  For example, for all of your nmap, msfvenom, etc commands are ready to go.  The purpose of this approach is to reduce the amount of manually entering details such as IP addresses / port numbers, etc.
